Malala decided to speak out on behalf of herself as well as the other girls she went to school with and because this it made her a target to the Taliban.One October day Malala was shot in the head from an extremist, her story is about survival, bravery, and determination.</p>

                Today, Malala goes around the world and meets women and girls with similar stories as hers. She hopes that their stories are heard too, to help show how women and girls are treated in other countries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Malala has created a foundation where all the proceeds go to educators and activists around the world. The more education on this topic of women inequality in other countries, hopefully more work will be done to help protect young women and their right to learn.
